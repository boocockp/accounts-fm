To Do

When possible
-------------


- Validation
- Why does accountInfos return an aggregator and accountSummary return a plain object?
- Store inputs after validation
- Ensure version correct for all classes
- Ensure sort works with all kinds of different sort expressions inc ones that use calculated values
- Active view components
- Joint stored input sequence
- Wiring with forward/circular references
- Refactor views

Done
----
    - Transaction Entry
    - Refactor Aggregators
    - Account updates in all places - balance, name in selects
    - Automatically create input data from form contents
    - List structures in forms
    - Generic account-select and encapsulate the native select OR extend native element
    - Number field
    - Account select keeps its selection when options updated
    - Update only select values when accounts change, leave form entries
    - Sort out _resolve so accountInfos does not need intermediate object - handle Aggregate and CachedSequence specially
    - Accounts by name sorted
    - View object resolution
