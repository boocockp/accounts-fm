To Do
=====

Next
----
- Decide how to inject an arbitrary local variable object into an html element in markup being generated
- Decide how to make account details update the whole set of accounts so updates transmitted


When possible
-------------


    - Transaction Entry
    - Refactor Aggregators
- Account updates
- Ensure version correct for all classes
- Ensure sort works with all kinds of different sort expressions inc ones that use calculated values
- Active view components
- Joint stored input sequence
    - Automatically create input data from form contents
    - List structures in forms
- Wiring with forward/circular references
- Refactor views
    - Generic account-select and encapsulate the native select OR extend native element
    - Number field
- Validation
- Account select keeps its selection when options updated

Done
----
    - Update only select values when accounts change, leave form entries
    - Sort out _resolve so accountInfos does not need intermediate object - handle Aggregate and CachedSequence specially
    - Accounts by name sorted
    - View object resolution
